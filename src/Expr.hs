-- | The AST, after it has been desugared. Changes include:
--
--    * de Bruijn index representation of local variables (Free variables retain
--    their string identifier).
--
--    * Pattern matching is de-coupled from the function notation, into a
--    separate Case expression which does not support nesting. Functions that
--    use patterns are desugared into a function whose formal parameters are
--    passed directly to a case expression.
--
--    * Function application supports arbitrary expressions in the callable
--    position, not just identifiers.
--
--    * Extra expressions (@ FailE @, @ FallThroughE @) have been added to
--    support the proper compilation of pattern matching.
