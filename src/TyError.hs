  -- Snippet of code

If two contexts have the same span, the outer is a child context, and the
inner is a parent context, and we print them together.

[decl -> list] -> [element -> function] -> argument -> let

print decl

[decl* -> list] -> [element -> function] -> argument -> let

print element of list

[element* -> function] -> argument -> let

print argument of function

*argument -> let

print let

element of list; argument of function application

[element -> function] -> argument
argument of function application

discard grandparent, print parent compacted with child
recurse with child still attached.
